step_pin: PB3
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin: PB4
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin: !PD2
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance: 8.48
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.
microsteps: 64
#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
step_pulse_duration: 0.000000100
#   The minimum time between the step pulse signal edge and the
#   following "unstep" signal edge. This is also used to set the
#   minimum time between a step pulse and a direction change signal.
#   The default is 0.000000100 (100ns) for TMC steppers that are
#   configured in UART or SPI mode, and the default is 0.000002 (which
#   is 2us) for all other steppers.
